	* Developed a user-friendly R Shiny web-application to deploy the best-performing prediction model.
	* Containerized parallelized R-based analyses in Docker and Singularity to minimize model training times on local high-performance computing clusters.
	* Minimized class imbalance effects of models using case-weighted models, subsampling techniques, and robust performance evaluation metrics.
	* Utilized both supervised machine learning and traditional statistical methods for pediatric patient traumatic brain injury predictive modeling.

* __UNR Department of Mathematics - Dr. Grant Schissler__ \- _Statistics Research Assistant_ (Aug. 2019 - Jan. 2020)
	* Recommended future medical student outcome data collection and data evaluation strategies.

I am currently working full-time at Pfizer Digital in NYC as an DRP Associate. At the moment, my work focuses on helping with projects in the Enterprise Architecture, Data & Analytics, and AI/ML team under Randy Duncan.

My Interests
======
The areas that I am most experienced in are biomedical data science and data software development, where I am specifically interested in prototyping data web-applications, cloud computing, and interactive data visualization. In addition to statistics, I enjoy learning about concepts in psychology and mental health. In my free time, I like to exercise and practice mindfulness meditation.

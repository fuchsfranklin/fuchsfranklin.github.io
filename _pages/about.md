I recently graduated with an honors BS in mathematics (statistics emphasis) and a minor in big data from UNR. This summer I am a software development intern at Pfizer, where I am working with Dr. Liang Xue and the Simulation and Modeling Science (SMS) group to deploy an automated pipeline incorporating existing tools for data processing, focusing on achieving ultrafast computing with high reproducibility and scalability, as well as data management and visualization. This fall, I will be attending The Johns Hopkins University for a master's in biostatistics.

My Interests
======
The areas that I am most interested in are predictive modeling, data software development, and biomedical data science. In addition to statistics and biostatistics, I enjoy learning about immunology and bioinformatics. Programming in relation to high-performance computing and web application development are other areas I find particularly engaging. In my free time, I like to code, exercise and practice mindfulness.

I am currently working at Pfizer in NYC as a Data Scientist and Digital Client Partner under [Ajit Jadhav](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-4XGT3IAAAAJ&hl=en), where my work focuses on implementing generative, operations research, and traditional statistical model solutions to help adress problems in global medical impact assessment and other adjacent areas. Under the guidance of [Melanie Tory](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-4XGT3IAAAAJ&hl=en) I am also pursuing my industry PhD at Northeastern University, focusing on problems at the intersection of data visualization, AI, design, and biomedical data science.

My Interests
======
The areas and ideas I (personally) think about a lot, often relate to [fat tailed distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10488) or more accessibly [black swan](https://www.randomhousebooks.com/books/176226/) type phenomena. I also like learning about concepts in psychology, especially behavioural science and mental health. In my free time, I like to exercise.

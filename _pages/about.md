I recently graduated with an honors mathematics BS (statistics emphasis) and a big data minor from UNR. This summer, I am a software development intern at Pfizer, where I am working with Dr. Liang Xue and the Simulation and Modeling Science (SMS) group to deploy an automated pipeline incorporating existing tools for data processing, focusing on achieving ultrafast computing with high reproducibility and scalability, as well as data management and visualization. This fall, I will be attending Johns Hopkins University for a master's in Biostatistics.

My Interests
======
The areas that I am most interested in are statistical computing, data software development, and data science. In addition to statistics and biostatistics, I enjoy learning about immunology and bioinformatics. Programming in relation to high-performance computing and web application development are other areas I find particularly engaging. In my free time, I like to code, I work out, and I practice mindfulness meditation.

Currently, I am attending Johns Hopkins University for a master's in biostatistics. With professor [Stephanie Hicks](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/) as my advisor, I am working on developing R/Shiny apps along with Python modules for image processing of spatial transcriptomics data.

My Interests
======
The areas that I am most interested in are biomedical data science and data software development, where I am specifically interested in web-application development, high-performance computing, and interactive data visualization. In addition to statistics, I enjoy learning about epidemiology. In my free time, I like to exercise, code, and practice mindfulness meditation.

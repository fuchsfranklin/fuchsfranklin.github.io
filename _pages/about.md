Currently, I am attending Johns Hopkins University for a master's in biostatistics, where I am working on content and package development for [DataTrail](https://www.datatrail.org/) under Professor Michael Rosenblum and Candace Savonen. This summer, I will start full-time work at the Pfizer Digital Group.

My Interests
======
The areas that I am most experienced in are biomedical data science and data software development, where I am specifically interested in web-application development, high-performance computing, and interactive data visualization. In addition to statistics, I enjoy learning about concepts in psychology and mental health. In my free time, I like to exercise and practice mindfulness meditation.

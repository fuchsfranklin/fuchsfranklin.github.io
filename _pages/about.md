I am currently working at Mondelēz as a Data Science Manager in the Marketing Acceleration and Insights Group under [Navneet Gill](https://www.linkedin.com/in/navneet-gill-33a76ba/) and [Rakesh Loonawat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rakeshloonawat/), where I focus on consumer research and providing product portfolio insights using methods in [Algorithmic Marketing](https://www.algorithmicmarketingbook.com/) and other adjacent areas in applied statistics.

My Interests
======
The areas and ideas I (personally) think about a lot often relate to [fat tailed distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10488), or more accessibly thought of as [black swan](https://www.randomhousebooks.com/books/176226/) type phenomena. I also like learning about concepts in psychology, especially behavioural science and mental health. In my free time I like to exercise.

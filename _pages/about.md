Currently, I am attending Johns Hopkins University for a master's in biostatistics. This summer I am working at the Pfizer Computational Sciences Group under Dr. Liang Xue.

My Interests
======
The areas that I am most experienced in are biomedical data science and data software development, where I am specifically interested in web-application development, high-performance computing, and interactive data visualization. In addition to statistics, I enjoy learning about concepts in bioinformatics. In my free time, I like to exercise, code, and practice mindfulness meditation.

I am currently working at Pfizer in NYC as a Data Scientist in Digital Client Partners under [Ajit Jadhav](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-4XGT3IAAAAJ&hl=en), where my work focuses on generative, operations research, and traditional statistical modeling. Under the guidance of Professor [Melanie Tory](https://roux.northeastern.edu/people/melanie-tory/) at Northeastern University and [Stephen Watt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-watt-88b5064/) at Pfizer, I am doing my industry PhD with a focus on problems at the intersection of data visualization, AI, design, and biomedical data science. 

My Interests
======
The areas and ideas I (personally) think about a lot often relate to [fat tailed distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10488), or more accessibly thought of as [black swan](https://www.randomhousebooks.com/books/176226/) type phenomena. I also like learning about concepts in psychology, especially behavioural science and mental health. In my free time I like to exercise.

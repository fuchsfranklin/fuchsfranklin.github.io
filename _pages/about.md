I recently graduated with an Honors BS in Mathematics \(Statistics Emphasis\) from UNR. This summer I am software development intern at Pfizer, where I am working with Dr. Liang Xue and the Simulation and Modeling Science (SMS) group to deploy an automated pipeline incorporating existing tools for data processing, focusing on achieving ultrafast computing with high reproducibility and scalability, as well as data management and visualization. This fall, I will be attending Johns Hopkins University for an ScM in Biostatistics.

My Interests
======
The areas that I am most interested in and have the most experience with are binary classification, dimensionality reduction, and predictive modeling. In addition to mathematics and statistics, I am especially interested in immunology and bioinformatics. Programming in relation to high-performance computing and web application development are other areas I find particularly engaging. In my free time, I like to code, I work out, and I practice mindfulness meditation.

I am currently working at Pfizer in NYC as a Software/Solution Engineer and DRP Associate. At the moment, my work focuses on helping with projects in the Enterprise Architecture, Data & Analytics, and AI/ML Team.

My Interests
======
The areas that I am most experienced in are biomedical data science and data software development, where I am specifically interested in cloud computing, prototyping data web-applications, and interactive data visualization. In addition to programming, I enjoy learning about concepts in psychology, especially behavioural science and mental health. In my free time, I like to exercise and practice mindfulness meditation.

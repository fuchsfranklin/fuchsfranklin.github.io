I recently graduated with an honors BS in mathematics (statistics emphasis) and a minor in big data from UNR. This summer I am a software development intern at Pfizer, where I am working with Dr. Liang Xue and the Simulation and Modeling Science (SMS) group to deploy an automated pipeline incorporating existing tools for data processing, focusing on achieving ultrafast computing with high reproducibility and scalability, as well as data management and visualization. This fall, I will be attending Johns Hopkins University for a master's in biostatistics.

My Interests
======
The areas that I am most interested in are biomedical data science and software development. In addition to statistics and biostatistics, I enjoy learning about epidemiology. Programming in relation web application development is another area I find engaging. In my free time, I like to code, exercise, and practice mindfulness meditation.

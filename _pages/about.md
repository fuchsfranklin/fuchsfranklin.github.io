Currently, I am attending Johns Hopkins University for a master's in biostatistics with Professor [Stephanie Hicks](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/) as my advisor. This summer, I am working in data science at the Pfizer Computational Sciences Group under [Dr. Liang Xue](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liang-xue-3a7b9722).

My Interests
======
The areas that I am most experienced in are biomedical data science and data software development, where I am specifically interested in web-application development, high-performance computing, and interactive data visualization. In addition to statistics, I enjoy learning about concepts in bioinformatics. In my free time, I like to exercise and practice mindfulness meditation.

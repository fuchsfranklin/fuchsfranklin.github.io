This is a page on things I am trying to think through a bit more rigorously, so writing them down forces me to articulate my thought process from end-to-end, thus stress-testing the chain of thought in a low stakes and fun sort of way.

{% include base_path %}
{% capture written_year %}'None'{% endcapture %}
{% for post in site.posts %}
  {% capture year %}{{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}{% endcapture %}
  {% if year != written_year %}
    <h2 id="{{ year | slugify }}" class="archive__subtitle">{{ year }}</h2>
    {% capture written_year %}{{ year }}{% endcapture %}
  {% endif %}
  {% include archive-single.html %}
{% endfor %}

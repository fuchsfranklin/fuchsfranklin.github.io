Some thoughts I'm trying to think through more completely. Writing them down forces me to articulate my reasoning from start to finish. This is mostly just for curiosity, fun, and scratching the ever-present itch to optimize things that don't necessarily need optimizing.

{% include base_path %}
{% capture written_year %}'None'{% endcapture %}
{% for post in site.posts %}
  {% capture year %}{{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}{% endcapture %}
  {% if year != written_year %}
    <h2 id="{{ year | slugify }}" class="archive__subtitle">{{ year }}</h2>
    {% capture written_year %}{{ year }}{% endcapture %}
  {% endif %}
  {% include archive-single.html %}
{% endfor %}

title: "Multi-Agentic Oncology Value Scorecard Creation with LLMs"
excerpt: "Based on some great discussions with my previous Pfizer colleagues [Brett South](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brett-south-phd-famia-50242349), [Jay Ronquillo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/geronimoronquillo), [Jon Mauer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-mauer), and [Stephen Watt](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LXkHB_8AAAAJ&hl=en), this project aims to replicate established oncology value frameworks, such as the ISPOR Scorecard and ASCO Value Framework, using Large Language Models (LLMs). The initial goal is to validate LLM capabilities in reproducing human-derived scorecards.

The project implements and compares three LLM-based approaches: multi-agent systems, single LLM pipelines, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), using data from ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed, and OpenFDA. A fourth, more advanced MOA-based multi-agent framework was later integrated for enhanced synthesis and traceability. Scorecard outputs were benchmarked against published gold standards to assess accuracy and reproducibility."

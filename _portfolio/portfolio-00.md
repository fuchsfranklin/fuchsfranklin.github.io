title: "Multi-Agentic Oncology Value Scorecard Creation with LLMs"
excerpt: "Based on some great discussions with my previous Pfizer colleagues [Brett South](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brett-south-phd-famia-50242349), [Jay Ronquillo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/geronimoronquillo), [Jon Mauer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-mauer), and [Stephen Watt](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LXkHB_8AAAAJ&hl=en), this project aims to replicate established oncology value frameworks, such as the ISPOR Scorecard and ASCO Value Framework, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to validate their capabilities in reproducing human-derived scorecards. The project implements and compares three LLM-based approaches—multi-agent systems, single LLM pipelines, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)—using data from ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed, and OpenFDA, with a fourth MOA-based multi-agent framework later integrated for enhanced synthesis and traceability."

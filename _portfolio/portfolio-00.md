title: "Multi-Agentic Oncology Value Scorecard Creation with LLMs"
excerpt: "This project explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to replicate and generate oncology value scorecards, such as the ASCO and ISPOR frameworks. These frameworks evaluate cancer treatments based on clinical benefit, toxicity, and other patient-centered outcomes. It implements and compares three LLM-based approaches: multi-agent systems, single LLM pipelines, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), using data from ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed, and OpenFDA. A fourth, more advanced MOA-based multi-agent framework was later integrated for enhanced synthesis and traceability. Scorecard outputs were benchmarked against published gold standards to assess accuracy and reproducibility. "

## Project Overview

###### _(R and Shiny-based Programming Project)_

 I created this project as my previous personal website to improve my R Shiny and HTML programming skills. Given that Shiny applications are more dynamic and are adapted to making statistical analyses more interactive, I decided to retire this web-application and use my current website instead.

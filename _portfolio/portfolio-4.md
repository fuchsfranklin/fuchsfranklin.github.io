excerpt: "I created this project as my previous personal website to improve my R Shiny and HTML programming skills. Given that Shiny applications are more dynamic and are adapted to visualizing and making statistical analyses more interactive, I decided to retire this web-application for my current faster-loading static website."

## Project Overview

###### _(R and Shiny-based Programming Project)_

"I created this project as my previous personal website to improve my R Shiny and HTML programming skills. Given that dynamic Shiny web-applicatioms can take a long time to load for every session and a personal website does not usually have any computational or interactive elements, I decided to retire this web-application for my current static website."

## Project Overview

###### _(R and Shiny-based Programming Project)_

 I created this project as my previous personal website to improve my R Shiny and HTML programming skills. Given that Shiny applications are more dynamic and are made for visualizing and making statistical analyses more interactive, I decided to retire this web-application for this current website.

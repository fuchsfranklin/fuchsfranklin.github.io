title: "Exploratory COVID-19 Modeling: Because There Weren't Already Enough Predictive COVID-19 Projects"
excerpt: "This project analyzes COVID-19 pandemic dynamics through three lenses: healthcare system strain, pandemic fatigue, and policy effectiveness. Using machine learning including ensemble methods, we predict ICU utilization with strong cross-country generalizability. We operationalize pandemic fatigue through a data-driven approach combining social media sentiment, policy stringency, and transmission trends. Finally, we quantify policy intervention lag using multiple time-series methods, revealing the temporal gap between implementation and observable effects. Interactive dashboard and full analysis available"

This project analyzes COVID-19 pandemic dynamics through three lenses: healthcare system strain, pandemic fatigue, and policy effectiveness.

We operationalize pandemic fatigue through a data-driven approach combining social media sentiment, policy stringency, and transmission trends.

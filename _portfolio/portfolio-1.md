title: "An R Shiny App to Introduce and Apply Basic Surival Analysis Ideas"
excerpt: "This is a project I am currently working on with Tiffany Hsieh and Bowen Chen at Hopkins to introduce and apply survival analysis ideas in the format of a web-application. Given a publicly available covid-related survival dataset on GitHub that we wanted to further explore, we aimed to outline several basic survival analysis concepts in a non-mathematical manner and then apply those concepts to the aforementioned dataset while making use of the interactivity elements R Shiny provides."

## Project Overview

###### _(R and Shiny-based Programming Project)_

This is a project I am currently working on with Tiffany Hsieh and Bowen Chen at Hopkins to introduce and apply survival analysis ideas in the format of a web-application. Given a publicly available covid-related survival dataset on GitHub that we wanted to further explore, we aimed to outline several basic survival analysis concepts in a non-mathematical manner and then apply those concepts to the aforementioned dataset while making use of the interactivity elements R Shiny provides.

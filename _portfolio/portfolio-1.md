title: "An R Shiny App to Introduce and Apply Survival Analysis Ideas"
excerpt: "Together with Tiffany Hsieh and Bowen Chen, I am working on this R Shiny web-application to introduce ideas in survival analysis in an accessible manner. Given a publicly available moderna vacchine covid-survival dataset on GitHub which we wanted to further explore, we outline several basic survival analysis concepts in a non-mathematical manner and then apply those concepts to the aforementioned dataset to provide intuition of concepts from both theoretical and applied perspectives."

## Project Overview

###### _(R and Shiny-based Programming Project)_

Together with Tiffany Hsieh and Bowen Chen, I am working on this R Shiny web-application to introduce ideas in survival analysis in an accessible manner. Given a publicly available moderna vacchine covid-survival dataset on GitHub which we wanted to further explore, we outline several basic survival analysis concepts in a non-mathematical manner and then apply those concepts to the aforementioned dataset to provide intuition of concepts from both theoretical and applied perspectives.

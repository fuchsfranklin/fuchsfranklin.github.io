title: "Enhancing DataTrail Data Science Education: The BaltimoreTrails R Package and Dashboard"
excerpt: "The BaltimoreTrails R package and associated dashboard are a comprehensive toolkit designed to facilitate the integration, manipulation, visualization, and interactive access of Baltimore datasets. Developed as part of the [DataTrail](https://www.datatrail.org/) initiative by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, this package and associated dashboard aim to provide a more localized, interactive, and relevant learning experience for students."

## Project Overview

###### _(R Package and Shiny-based Dashboard)_

Data science education is a rapidly evolving field, with a growing demand for
interactive and personalized learning experiences. The [DataTrail](https://www.datatrail.org/) curriculum, developed
by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, is a pioneering initiative in
this regard, offering a comprehensive and accessible platform for data science learning. This work introduces BaltimoreTrails, a tool designed to enhance the existing
DataTrail curriculum by integrating local data and providing interactive tools for
data manipulation and visualization.
BaltimoreTrails, the focus of this work, is a comprehensive tool that integrates
Baltimore datasets into an interactive Shiny Web-App, providing a localized and
relevant learning experience for students. Additionally, this work presents the
development of an R package, offering a suite of functions and tools for data
manipulation and visualization. This package, designed to be user-friendly and
accessible, is a valuable resource for both students and teachers.
The development of BaltimoreTrails is a significant contribution to the DataTrail
initiative, enhancing its capabilities and expanding its reach [21]. However, challenges,
particularly in integrating the Baltimore datasets with the learnR chapter tutorials
in the Shiny Web-App [26], will be discussed in detail in this work.
The subsequent sections will provide a detailed overview of the DataTrail initiative,
the development of the R package and Shiny Web-App, and the integration of
Baltimore datasets. We will also discuss the challenges encountered during this
process and potential areas for future improvement.

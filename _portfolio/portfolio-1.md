title: "An R Shiny App to Introduce and Apply Survival Analysis Ideas"
excerpt: "Together with Tiffany Hsieh and Bowen Chen, I am working on this R Shiny web-application to introduce ideas and provide intuition of survival analysis concepts from both theoretical and applied perspectives. Given a publicly available Moderna vaccine survival dataset on GitHub which we wanted to further explore, we outline several basic survival analysis concepts in a non-mathematical manner and then apply those concepts to the aforementioned dataset."

## Project Overview

###### _(R and Shiny-based Programming Project)_

Together with Tiffany Hsieh and Bowen Chen, I am working on this R Shiny web-application to introduce ideas and provide intuition of survival analysis concepts from both theoretical and applied perspectives. Given a publicly available Moderna vaccine survival dataset on GitHub which we wanted to further explore, we outline several basic survival analysis concepts in a non-mathematical manner and then apply those concepts to the aforementioned dataset.
